I always wanted to learn it and I got really excited when I saw a Kaggle competition on it , although I was not able to fully concentrate on it due to other competitions up untill now. While I was learning all the different concepts in Object Detection , I came across Facebook's **Detection tranformer DETR** , launched in April 2020 . It's still quite new but the resuts are astonishing and the model itself is very fast . In this notebook, I explore this new architecture,its working and fine tune it for Wheat Detection competition Dataset.\n\nNote that for now this is just a baseline to demonstrate the architecture and its working ,it does not aim at getting very good results on lb,this will be a work in progress,and I will soon update with full training and a separate ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# DETR (Detection Transformer)\n\nAttention is all you need,paper for Transformers,changed the state of NLP and has achieved great hieghts. Though mainly developed for NLP , the latest research around it focuses on how to leverage it across different verticals of deep learning. Transformer acrhitecture is very very powerful, and is something which is very close to my part,this is the reason I am motivated to explore anything that uses transformers , be it google's recently released Tabnet or OpenAI's ImageGPT .\n\nDetection Transformer leverages the transformer network(both encoder and the decoder) for Detecting Objects in Images . Facebook's researchers argue that for object detection one part of the image should be in contact with the other part of the image for greater result especially with ocluded objects and partially visible objects, and what's better than to use transformer for it.\n\n**The main motive behind DETR is effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode prior knowledge about the task and makes the process complex and computationally expensive**\n\nThe main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, <font color='green'>are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture.</font>\n\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-from-2020-05-27-17-48-38.png)\n\n<font color='red'>Interesting Right??

Crop and resize data augmentations to be used for model training.\n* Images are taken at various lighting conditions. Special filters should be used to address that.\n* Bounding boxes are messy!\n\n**There are some Giant bounding boxes and some micro bounding boxes removal of which have reported bad lb, so I assume the noise is present in the test setas well, hence keeping them would be more benificial**\n\nKeeping all this in find we start with coding DETR , **Note that this code can be used and easily modified to other object detection tasks**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.git   #cloning github repo of detr to import its unique loss","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Now if you have seen the video , you know that DETR uses a special loss called Bipartite Matching loss where it assigns one ground truth bbox to a predicted box using a matcher , thus when fine tuning we need the matcher (hungarian matcher as used in paper) and also the fucntion SetCriterion which gives Bipartite matching loss for backpropogation.
